This repository contains Python solutions (Jupyter Notebooks) for the Mathematical Statistics course. The projects focus on data modeling, statistical inference, and computational methods.

Course Syllabus & Topics Covered:
1. **Discrete Random Variables:** Analysis of probability mass functions and distributions.
2. **Continuous Random Variables:** Modeling probability density functions and cumulative distributions.
3. **Multidimensional Random Variables:** Joint distributions and dependency analysis.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Statistical summaries, data cleaning, and visualization.
5. **Random Sampling:** Methods for generating and analyzing representative data samples.
6. **Parametric Estimation:** Point and interval estimation of distribution parameters.
7. **Non-parametric Estimation:** Kernel density estimation and distribution-free methods.
8. **Bootstrap Estimation:** Computational resampling methods for statistical inference.
9. **Parametric Hypothesis Testing:** Significance tests for means, variances, and proportions.
10. **Non-parametric Hypothesis Testing:** Tests for goodness-of-fit and independence.
11. **Bootstrap & Permutation Tests:** Advanced resampling techniques for hypothesis verification.
